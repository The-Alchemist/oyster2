In this section we clarify our understanding of the concept of metadata for ontologies:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Metadata - data about data</li>
<li>Ontology Metadata - metadata which provides information about ontologies</li>
<li>Metadata Ontology - an ontology representing metadata information</li>
<li>Metadata Entity - an element of a metadata scheme</li>
<li>OMV - Ontology Metadata Vocabulary - The acronym of the proposed ontology
metadata scheme</li>
<li>Metadata Categories - we differentiate among the following three occurrence constraints
for metadata elements, according to their impact on the prospected reusability
of the described ontological content:
	<dl>
		<dt>Required - mandatory metadata elements. Any missing entry in this category
		leads to an incomplete description of the ontology.</dt>
		<dt>Optional - important metadata facts, but not strongly required.</dt>
		<dt>Extensional - specialized metadata entities, which are not considered to be
		part of the core metadata scheme.</dt>
	</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>

Complementary to this classification we organize the metadata elements according
to the type and purpose of the contained information as follows:
<ul>
<li>General - elements providing general information about the ontology.</li>
<li>Availability - information about the location of the ontology (e.g. its URI or
URL where the ontology is published on the Web)</li>
<li>Applicability - information about the intended usage or scope of the ontology.</li>
<li>Format - information about the physical representation of the resource. In
terms of ontologies these elements include information about the representation
language(s) in which the ontology is formalized.</li>
<li>Provenance - information about the organizations contributing to the creation
of the ontology.</li>
<li>Relationship - information about relationships to other resources. This category
include versioning, as well as conceptual relationships such as extensions,
generalization/specialization and imports.</li>
<li>Statistics - various metrics on the underlying graph topology of an ontology
(e.g. number of classes)</li>
<li>Other - information not covered in the categories listed above.</li>
</ul>
Note that the introduced classification dimensions are not intended to be part of the
metadata scheme itself, but will be used help avoid cluttering the interface of this plugin
by grouping the graphical elements associated with each property according to the
category their properties belong to.
