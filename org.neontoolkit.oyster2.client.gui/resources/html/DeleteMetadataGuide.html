<h1>Deleting metadata</h1>

<p>
In addition to the submit and update metadata features, the NeOn Toolkit Oyster GUI
has the capability of removing metadata from the Oyster server (in other words,
removing instances of OMV classes from the registry).
</p>
<p>
To remove an OMV instance, the user needs to retrieve the OMV instance 
to be deleted using the search feature. When the results view shows the instance
the user must select it and bring up the context menu to select the
delete entry.<br>
