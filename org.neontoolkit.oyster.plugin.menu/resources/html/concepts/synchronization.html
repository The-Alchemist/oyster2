<p><B>Synchronization</B>: <a href="oyster.html">Oyster</a> follows a synchronization approach that is a combination of a push and pull mechanism. During the
synchronization, nodes contact other nodes in the network to exchange updated information (pull changes) and optionally they can
push their changes to a specific node (called the <a href="pushNode.html">push node</a>) such that if a node goes offline before all other nodes pull the new
changes, the node changes are not lost.</p>
