<body>

<P>The purpose of the Oyster menu plugin is to provide a global access point to 
any plugin that needs to use the <a href="concepts/oyster.html">Oyster</a> ontology registry and to let the users 
to configure/manage the registry. Specifically it provides the following 
functionalities: </P>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Start/Stop the Ontology Registry</B>: This functionality is available 
  from the Registry menu and/or from the action associated to the Oyster icon in 
  the main toolbar; 
  <LI><B>Configure the initialization parameters</B>: This functionality is 
  available from the Oyster storage preference page. It provides the following 
	configuration options: 
  <UL>
    <LI><B><a href="concepts/superNode.html">Super Node</a> IP</B>: This option 
	allows to configure the IP address of a &quot;super&quot; node that will be used by 
	the registry to store/retrieve the metadata. Any node in the network running
	<a href="concepts/oyster.html">Oyster</a> can be configured as the &quot;super&quot; 
	node, however in general this is a node running
	<a href="concepts/oyster.html">Oyster</a> in server mode. Usually this 
	option is configured when the user will be working with a NTK collaboration 
	server; 
    <LI><B><a href="concepts/pushNode.html">Push Node</a> IP</B>: This option 
	allows to configure the IP address of a specific node in the network to 
	which changes will be push propagated every time the
	<a href="concepts/synchronization.html">Syncrhonization</a> process is 
	invoked. Usually this option is configured when users are working 
	collaborative on the development of ontologies in a totally distributed 
	environment (i.e. users are working with local copies of the same ontology 
	and there is no NTK collaboration server) to ensure that every node in the 
	network interested in the same ontology will be able to pull propagate 
	changes from other nodes even if the nodes go offline; 
    <LI><B>Read ontologies locally</B>: This option allows to specify that the 
	ontologies necessary to start the registry (e.g. OMV and related) are loaded 
	from the local filesystem. By default ontologies are loaded from the 
	internet and therefore it takes a little bit longer to start the registry. 
	If this option is selected, the user should ensure that the required 
	ontologies are available in the O2ServerFiles directory within the NTK 
	working directory (i.e. where the NeOn_Toolkit.exe file is located). Users 
	can download the pack of ontologies from <A class="external free"

    <LI><B>Reset <a href="concepts/oyster.html">Oyster</a></B>: This options 
	allows the user to reset <a href="concepts/oyster.html">Oyster</a> i.e. 
	delete the current information and settings. To apply this action, the user 
	should ensure that the registry is not running. </LI>
