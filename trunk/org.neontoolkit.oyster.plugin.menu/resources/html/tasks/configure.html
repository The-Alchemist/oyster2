&nbsp;It provides the following 
  configuration options: 
  <UL>
    <LI><B><a href="../concepts/superNode.html">Super Node</a> IP</B>: This option allows to configure the IP address of 
    a "super" node that will be used by the registry to store/retrieve the 
    metadata. Any node in the network running <a href="../concepts/oyster.html">Oyster</a> can be configured as the 
    "super" node, however in general this is a node running
	<a href="../concepts/oyster.html">Oyster</a> in server 
    mode. Usually this option is configured when the user will be working with a 
    NTK collaboration server; 
    <LI><B><a href="../concepts/pushNode.html">Push Node</a> IP</B>: This option allows to configure the IP address of a 
    specific node in the network to which changes will be push propagated every 
    time the <a href="../concepts/synchronization.html">Syncrhonization</a> process is invoked. Usually this option is 
    configured when users are working collaborative on the development of 
    ontologies in a totally distributed environment (i.e. users are working with 
    local copies of the same ontology and there is no NTK collaboration server) 
    to ensure that every node in the network interested in the same ontology 
    will be able to pull propagate changes from other nodes even if the nodes go 
    offline; 
    <LI><B>Read ontologies locally</B>: This option allows to specify that the 
    ontologies necessary to start the registry (e.g. OMV and related) are loaded 
    from the local filesystem. By default ontologies are loaded from the 
    internet and therefore it takes a little bit longer to start the registry. 
    If this option is selected, the user should ensure that the required 
    ontologies are available in the O2ServerFiles directory within the NTK 
    working directory (i.e. where the NeOn_Toolkit.exe file is located). Users 
    can download the pack of ontologies from <A class="external free"

    rel=nofollow>http://oyster2.ontoware.org/ontologiesPack</A>. 
    <LI><B>Reset <a href="../concepts/oyster.html">Oyster</a></B>: This options allows the user to reset
	<a href="../concepts/oyster.html">Oyster</a> i.e. 
    delete the current information and settings. To apply this action, the user 
    should ensure that the registry is not running.</LI></UL>
