<strong>Ontology Metadata Vocabulary (OMV)</strong>&nbsp; is a metadata schema 
that captures relevant information about ontologies such as provenance, 
availability, statistics, etc. Besides the main class Ontology, OMV also models 
additional classes and properties required to support the reuse of ontologies, 
such as Organisation, Person, LicenseModel, OntologyLanguage and Ontology- Task 
among others.&nbsp; OMV distinguishes between the OMV Core and various OMV 
Extensions. The former captures information which is expected to be relevant to 
the majority of ontology reuse settings. However, in order to allow ontology 
developers and users to specify task- or application-specific ontology-related 
information we foresee the development of OMV extension modules, which are 
physically separated from the core scheme, while remaining compatible to its 
elements. For additional information we refer the reader to
