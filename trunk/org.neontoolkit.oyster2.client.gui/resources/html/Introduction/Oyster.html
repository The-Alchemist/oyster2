Generally speaking, Oyster is meant to be a registry that allows ontology users and developers to share
ontologies, holding references to ontologies and a description of these. This way, developers should be able to
let interested people to know that they have created an ontology, it's purpose, domain, and so on. On the
other hand, people interested in using an existing ontology matching some needs should be able to search the registry
for such an ontology using some criteria. To ease description of ontologies in the registry,
Oyster uses OMV to describe ontologies, as it's becoming a de facto standard.

<p>
From the point of view of this plugin, Oyster is the server it connects to.
For the purpose of this plugin it's a server that exposes an interface as a web service.
It can receive SOAP messages to submit new instances of OMV classes, update or delete existing ones,
and query for them, using any classes' properties as query parameters.
