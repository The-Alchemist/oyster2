Ontologies are intended to be used as a shared means of communication between computers
and between humans and computers. A core requirement for the achievement of
this goal is the usage of open standards and technologies for the representation, description,
access and exchange of the ontological sources. Consider, for example, the W3C
standardized Web Ontology Language OWL. Using this representation language instead
of a proprietary format would clearly increase the usability of an ontology at Web
scale. The same applies for the means employed to describe existing ontologies or for the
technological infrastructure supporting their management and exchange.
In contrast to plain Web documents, the majority of implemented ontologies are currently
put into widespread use on the Web without any additional metadata information.
This deficiency seriously affects the reusability of Semantic Web ontologies: without any
metadata information potential ontology users can not find and deploy them effectively
and efficiently. In order to cope with this problem, it is necessary to agree on a standard
for ontology metadata, a vocabulary of terms and definitions describing ontologies,
replicating the positive experiences in other information management areas e.g. Digital
libraries, implementing such a vocabulary

OMV is a vocabulary meant to allow the formal description of ontologies, making it
possible for a machine to manage a registry of ontologies, classifying them, and
searching particular ontologies according to certain criteria.
