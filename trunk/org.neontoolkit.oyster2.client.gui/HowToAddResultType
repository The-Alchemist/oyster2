This file might be obsolete and nowadays more steps could be needed
due to incoming i18n

1. Add the corresponding lines to resources/ResultsAdapterConfiguration.properties
 (see the existing ones for Ontology_Type)


2. Add a file in org/neontoolkit/oyster2/client/gui/adapter/results/ to 
 hold property labels, like in the example Ontology_TypeLabels.properties.
 The name of the file is referenced in the file edited in point 1.
 
3. Add a file in resources/ to describe the result type, like the Ontology_Type.properties .

The property names must be the same in the files edited in steps 2 and 3.
