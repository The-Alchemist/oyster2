<body>

<p>The purpose of the Oyster import wizard plugin is to allow users to
find and select ontologies based on their available <a href="concepts/omv.html">OMV</a> metadata
usually for reusing activities. Specifically it provides the following
functionalities: </p>
<ul><li> <b>Search ontologies</b>: Users can search for ontologies
based on the <a href="concepts/omv.html">OMV</a> metadata (available in 
	<a href="concepts/oyster.html">Oyster</a> ontology registry). The
search can be performed locally (in local Oyster node), or distributed
(to all appropriate Oyster nodes);
</li><li> <b>Import ontologies</b>: Once the user find the most
suitable ontology for his requirements, he can import it directly into
the his NTK workspace. Note that the registry provides the URL where
the ontology is located, not the actual ontology.</li></ul>


<p><strong>Note: </strong>Oyster-importWizard is subsumed by Oyster-GUI and it will no longer be supported </p>
