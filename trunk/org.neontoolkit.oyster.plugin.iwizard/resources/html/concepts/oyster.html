<p><strong>Oyster</strong> is a distributed registry that exploits semantic web techniques in 
order to provide a solution for exchanging and re-using ontologies and related 
entities. As an <I>ontology registry</I> , it provides services for storage, 
cataloging, discovery, management, and retrieval of ontology (and related 
entities) metadata definitions. To achieve these goals, Oyster implements the 
proposal for metadata standard <a href="omv.html">OMV</a>&nbsp; as the way to describe ontologies and 
related entities, supporting advanced semantic searches of the registered 
objects and providing services to support the management and evolution of 
ontologies in distributed environments. For more information we refer the reader
