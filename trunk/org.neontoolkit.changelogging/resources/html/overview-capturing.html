<p>The purpose of this plug-in is to capture ontology changes from the
NTK editor and log them into <a href="concepts/oyster.html">Oyster</a> distributed registry. This plug-in
also allows users to visualize the history of ontology changes.
Additionally, this plug-in is in charge of applying changes received
from other clients to the same ontology after <a href="concepts/oyster.html">Oyster</a>
<a href="concepts/synchronization.html">synchronizes</a> the
changes in the distributed environment. Finally, this plug-in allows
users to request <a href="concepts/oyster.html">Oyster</a> to start the
<a href="concepts/synchronization.html">synchronization</a> process.
Specifically it provides the following functionalities: </p>
<ul><li> <b>Start/Stop Ontology Logging</b>: This functionality is
available from the option "Log Changes" in the pop-up menu of the
ontology objects in the NTK editor. When an ontology is being logged,
the plug-in performs the following tasks on the background:
<ul><li> <b>Capture Ontology Changes</b>: Every change from the NTK editor is captured.
</li><li> <b>Transform Ontology Changes</b>: Every change in the editor is transformed into instances of the change representation model (Change Ontology).
</li><li> <b>Register Ontology Changes</b>: The instances of the change ontology are registered into
	<a href="concepts/oyster.html">Oyster</a> distributed registry.
</li></ul>
</li><li> <b>Visualize Ontology Changes</b>: This functionality is
available from the "Change Log View" provided by the plug-in. From this
view, users can visualize the ontologies that are being logged and for
each of them, the history of changes sorted in chronological order. The
list of changes is displayed in a table that shows the most relevant
information (e.g. author of the change, time of the change, type of the
change, etc.) and when a change is selected the complete information is
displayed in the interface.
</li><li> <b>Start <a href="concepts/synchronization.html">Synchronization</a></b>: This functionality is
available from the option "Synchronize" in the pop-up menu of the
ontology objects in the NTK editor. When this option is selected, the
plug-in performs the following tasks on the background:
<ul><li> <b>Launch <a href="concepts/synchronization.html">Synchronization</a> Process</b>: This task request
	<a href="concepts/oyster.html">Oyster</a> to start the
	<a href="concepts/synchronization.html">Synchronization</a> process.
</li><li> <b>Apply Changes Received</b>: After the
	<a href="concepts/synchronization.html">synchronization</a>
finishes, the plug-in applies locally (if necessary) changes received
from other clients to the same ontology. When changes are applied
locally, they are reflected in the NTK editor updating the local
ontology with the changes received.
