<br/>
2. Please log on first in the preference page which have been introduced above and choose an OWL ontology to be tracked by right-clicking an OWL ontology in Ontology Navigator in NeOn Toolkit and then select "Log changes". We will introduce the four views according to the role you have registered.<br/>
<br/>
3. If you are a viewer, you have no right to make some changes. But you could browse all the changes in different states (by clicking on the button of "Refresh Changes List") which are made by the subject experts or validated by the validators. All the changes are shown in grey. <br/>
<br/>
4. If you are a subject expert, you could make some changes for an OWL ontology 
in the Ontology Navigator in NeOn Toolkit. In the Draft view, you could manipulate 
these changes by submitting some changes to be approved by clicking the button of 
"Submit Changes to To be Approved" or deleting the changes by clicking the button 
of "Delete". See Figure 2 which is an example of Draft View. Please note that you 
can not manage the changes made by other users which are shown in grey.
